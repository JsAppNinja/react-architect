Snackbars provide lightweight feedback about an operation by showing a brief message
at the bottom of the screen. Snackbars can contain an action.

The most effective way to use the `Snackbar` component is to have a global
snackbar that gets toasts pushed to it through some state framework (such as
Redux).
