The `Toolbar` component can be used as a fixed `App Bar`, or just a simple container
for a few actions.

### Sizing
According to the material design spec, the toolbar changes height based on the device and orientation.
This can actually make things very difficult to style and adds complexity for styling. I recommend
making a static [$md-toolbar-height](/components/toolbars?tab=2#variable-md-toolbar-height) instead.
