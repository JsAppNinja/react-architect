Text fields allow the user to input text, select text, and lookup data via auto-completion.
The text fields can be displayed with floating labels or just a simplified block with a
placeholder. There is also built-in support for displaying help text, error text, counters,
and icons along with the text field. The password text fields also allow for the user to
temporarily view the text in the field.
