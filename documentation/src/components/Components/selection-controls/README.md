The `SelectionControl` component can be used to create either a `Checkbox`, `Radio`, or
`Switch` component. Unfortunately, if you want to use a \`Radio\` component, you will
manually need to control the \`checked\` state of the radio group. This is a component
\`SelectionControlGroup\` that can be used instead to help with this (and offer keyboard
accessibility).
