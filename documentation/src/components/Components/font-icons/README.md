The `FontIcon` component is used to render different font libraries
with the material design specs. The default font icon library used
is the Material Icons.

Starting from v1.1.0, a dense spec has been added to icons. This will
automatically reduce the icon size from `24px` to `20px` when viewing
the website when the desktop media query matches. This behavior can be
disabled by setting `$md-font-icon-include-dense` to `false` if this is
not desired behavior.
