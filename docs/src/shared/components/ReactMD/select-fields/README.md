A select field is called a Dropdown Button in the
[material design specs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons).

A dropdown button selects between multiple selections. The button
displays the current state and a down arrow. Available states may
be shown as a list of strings, a palette, or icons, for example.
