The `Toolbar` component can be used as a fixed `App Bar`, or just a simple container
for a few actions.

When you are using a `fixed` Toolbar (aka `App Bar`), if you apply the `.md-toolbar-relative`
class name to the main content of the page (or something you want adjusted), it will
gain a margin-top equal to the current height of the toolbar based on the device/screen
size.

### Positioning CSS
Since the toolbar is normally used as a fixed component, some additional helper class names have been
created to help position content relative to a toolbar.

#### `md-toolbar-relative`
This class name will apply a `margin-top` to whatever element or component it has been applied to for the current
media's toolbar height.

#### `md-toolbar-relative--prominent`
This class name is similar to the `md-toolbar-relative` except that it is used with prominent toolbars instead.

#### `md-btn--toolbar`
This applies additional margin to buttons to center them vertically in the toolbar. This should only be used if
the buttons are not occuring in the `actions` or `nav` props.

#### `md-toolbar--action-left`
This applies additional `margin-left` to any elements to position to the left keyline in a toolbar. This should really
only be used if not using the `nav` and `title` props in a toolbar.

#### `md-toolbar--action-right`
This applies additional `margin-right` to any elements to position to the left keyline in a toolbar. This should really
only be used if not using the `actions` props in a toolbar.

#### `md-title--toolbar`
This applies additional styles for a title in the toolbar. This should only be used if not using the `title` prop
on a toolbar.

#### `md-title--toolbar-offset`
This applies additional margin-left to the title in the toolbar to match the current keyline. This should probably
only be used if not using the `title` prop on a toolbar.

#### `md-title--toolbar-prominent`
This applies additional styles to move the title to a more prominent section in the toolbar. This should probably
only be used if not using the `title` prop on a toolbar.
