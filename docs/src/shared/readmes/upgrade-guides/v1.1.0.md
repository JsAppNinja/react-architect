## Upgrading to 1.1.0
### Icons
Since there was a dense spec for icons disabled, you might want to disable `$md-font-icon-include-dense` if you
were used to the look and feel without dense icons. It really changes the size of icons to be `20px` on desktop
screens instead of the normal `24px`.

### Dialogs
If you were using the UMD build or specifying `import { Dialog } from 'react-md'`, your app will probably now
be broken. One of the changes that was made in this release was to expose the `Dialog` itself instead of just
the container that displays it. The switch will be do specify `import { DialogContainer } from 'react-md'` instead.

### Tables
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).

### Toolbars
If you were using the Sass variable `$md-toolbar-mobile-prominent-height`, it is recommended to switch over to `md-toolbar-prominent-height`. It
is now defaulted to have a single prominent height across all screen sizes.
