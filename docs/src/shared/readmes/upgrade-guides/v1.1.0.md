## Upgrading to 1.1.0
### DataTables
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).

### Dialogs
If you were using the UMD build or specifying:
```js
import { Dialog } from 'react-md';
```
your app will probably be broken now.  One of the changes that was made in this release was to expose the `Dialog`
itself instead of just the container that displays it. The switch will be do specify
```js
import { DialogContainer } from 'react-md';
```
instead.

### FontIcons
Since there was a dense spec for icons disabled, you might want to set
```scss
$md-font-icon-include-dense: false;
```
if you were used to the look and feel without dense icons. It really changes the size of icons to be `20px`
on desktop screens instead of the normal `24px`.

### Portals
All the components that were using the `Portal` component in the previous release are *not* using it by default now.
The `Portal` ended up being too much of a hassle when dealing with server side rendering since it renders in a new
subtree once the DOM is available. Components affected:

- `BottomNavigation`
- `Dialog`
- `Drawer`
- `NavigationDrawer`
- `Snackbar`
- `DatePicker`/`TimePicker`

If it is still desired to have the `Portal` subtree rendering enabled for these components, just enable `portal` as
a prop.

> The Drawer/NavigationDrawer will still render the overlay for temporary drawers in a new subtree. If the Drawer
starts out as `defaultVisible` from the server, there _might_ be a server side rendering error message still.

### Lists
#### ListItem
The `ListItem` props `isOpen` and `defaultOpen` have been deprecated in favor of `visible` and `defaultVisible`. This change
has happened to keep the same naming conventions with other components.

### Toolbars
If you were using the Sass variable `$md-toolbar-mobile-prominent-height`, it is recommended to switch over to `md-toolbar-prominent-height`. It
is now defaulted to have a single prominent height across all screen sizes.
