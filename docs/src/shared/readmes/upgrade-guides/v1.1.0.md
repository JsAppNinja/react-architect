## Upgrading to 1.1.0
### Dialogs
If you were using the UMD build or specifying `import { Dialog } from 'react-md'`, your app will probably now
be broken. One of the changes that was made in this release was to expose the `Dialog` itself instead of just
the container that displays it. The switch will be do specify `import { DialogContainer } from 'react-md'` instead.

### Tables
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).
