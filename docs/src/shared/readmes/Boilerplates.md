# Boilerplates

To help with getting a project started, there are a few boilerplates available.

### [react-md-redux](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md-redux)
This boilerplate is basically the [react-cool-starter](https://github.com/wellyshen/react-cool-starter) but using
react-md as the UI framework and does not have any testing setup, since that is still very opinionated.


> This will be a growing list in the future. Feel free to do a pull request to add more.
