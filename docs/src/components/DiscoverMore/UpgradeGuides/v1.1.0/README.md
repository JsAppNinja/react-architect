## Upgrading to 1.1.0
A lot of components had their props renamed to follow a more consistent naming scheme between all components. There were a couple
of components that still used `isOpen`, `defaultOpen`, or `onSOMETHINGToggle` (`onVisibilityToggle`). They have now been renamed to `visible`, `defaultVisible`,
and `onSOMETHINGChange` (`onVisibilityChange`). This _should_ not break any functionality in your app, but it will display helpful
migration messages for you.

To help combat the weird resizing of content when a `Dialog` is opened, the `html` has been modified to gain a
`min-width: 100%`. This can be changed by the [md-html-min-width](/customization/typography?tab=1#variable-md-html-min-width) variable.

## Buttons
Buttons have added deprecation warnings for using the `label` prop. Instead of using the label, it is always preferred to use
the `children` to render any content in the button. There is backwards compatibility built in so this should not be a breaking
change but just a helpful migration warning.

In addition with these changes, it is preferred to use the new `iconEl` instead of the `iconChildren` and `iconClassName` props. There is
some better SVG support when using this prop.

## DataTables
The unique id generation for EditDialogColumn and SelectFieldColumn have been updated to also include the current cell index.
```js
// Before
const id = `${baseId}-${rowIndex}-edit-dialog`;
const id = `${baseId}-${rowIndex}-select`;

// After
const id = `${baseId}-${rowIndex}-${colIndex}-edit-dialog-field`;
const id = `${baseId}-${rowIndex}-${colIndex}-select-field`;
```

### DataTable
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).

The behavior of the `style` and `className` props have been changed based on the `responsive` prop. Before this release,
it was impossible to apply `style` and `className` to the surrounding responsive container for the tables. The behavior
of the `DataTable` component will now apply `style` and `className` to the responsive container and `tableStyle`/`tableClassName`
to the `<table>` when `responsive` is enabled. If `responsive` is disabled, the `style` and `className` will be applied to the
`<table>` and `tableStyle`/`tableClassName` are invalid.

With the new support for `SVGIcon`s, the `checkedIconChildren`, `checkedIconClassName`, `uncheckedIconChildren` and `uncheckedIconClassName`
props have been deprecated. Please use the `checkedIcon` and `uncheckedIcon` props instead.

### TableRow
The `autoAdjust` prop has now been deprecated for performance reasons. Please enable the `grow` prop on one of the `TableColumn` in the header
to get the old functionality back.

### TableColumn
The `sortIconChildren` and `sortIconClassName` props have been deprecated. Please use the `sortIcon` prop instead.

#### EditDialogColumn
The `EditDialogColumn` has been updated to automatically stay within the `DataTable`'s responsive container. In addition,
the "Ok" and "Cancel" buttons in a large dialog have been updated to have more styling options.

- `okPrimary` [added](/components/data-tables?tab=1#edit-dialog-column-proptypes-ok-primary).
- `okSecondary` [added](/components/data-tables?tab=1#edit-dialog-column-proptypes-ok-secondary).
- `cancelPrimary` [added](/components/data-tables?tab=1#edit-dialog-column-proptypes-cancel-primary).
- `cancelSecondary` [added](/components/data-tables?tab=1#edit-dialog-column-proptypes-cancel-secondary).
- `enforceMinWidth` deprecated.
- `scrollThreshold` deprecated.
- `transitionDuration` deprecated.
- `inlineIconChildren` and `inlineIconClassName` props have been deprecated. Use the `inlineIcon` prop instead.
- `noIcon` deprecated. Just set the `inlineIcon` prop to `null` to remove any icons.

### SelectFieldColumn
The `SelectFieldColumn` was also updated to automatically stay within the `DataTable`'s responsive container. With the new
changes, it also does not require an additional wrapper to get the menu to overflow correctly.

- `wrapperStyle` deprecated.
- `wrapperClassname` deprecated.

### Dialogs
If you were using the UMD build or specifying `import { Dialog } from 'react-md'`, your app will probably now
be broken. One of the changes that was made in this release was to expose the `Dialog` itself instead of just
the container that displays it.
```js
// Before
import { Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD

// After
import { DialogContainer as Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { DialogContainer: Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD
```

### Drawers
- `closeOnNavItemClick` deprecated. Please use the `autoclose` prop instead. (It existed before)
- `onVisibilityToggle` deprecated. Please use `onVisibilityChange` instead.

### ExpansionPanels
#### ExpansionPanel
- `expandIconChildren` and `expandIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `expanderIcon` prop instead.

### FileInputs
- `iconChildren` and `iconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `icon` prop instead.

### FontIcons
Since there was a dense spec for icons disabled, you might want to set
```scss
$md-font-icon-include-dense: false;
```
if you were used to the look and feel without dense icons. It really changes the size of icons to be `20px`
on desktop screens instead of the normal `24px`.

### Lists
#### ListItem
- `isOpen` deprecated - Use `visible` instead.
- `defaultOpen` deprecated - Use `defaultVisible` instead.
- `expanderIconChildren` and `expanderIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `expanderIcon` prop instead.

### Menus
The Menu component was redone to stay within the viewport. It also has a lot of other niceties built in now. If you were using
the `Menu.Positions.CONTEXT` before, it has been deprecated. To create a context menu now, all you need to do is provide a
`onContextMenu` prop. The component will now automatically set the positioning of the context menu for you as well.

- `isOpen` deprecated. Please use the `visible` prop instead.
- `contained` deprecated. Please use the `sameWidth` prop instead.
- `Menu.Positions.CONTEXT` deprecated. To create context menus, just provide the `onContextMenu` callback prop instead.

#### MenuButton
The `MenuButton` was updated to move the list of items to be the `menuItems` prop instead of the `children`.

- `buttonChildren` deprecated. But any children for the button in the children of the `MenuButton` itself.
- `onMenuToggle` deprecated. Please use the `onVisibilityChange` prop instead.
- `isOpen` deprecated. Please use the `visible` prop instead.
- `defaultOpen` deprecated. Please use the `defaultVisible` prop instead.
- `menuItems` - This should be the list of `number`, `string`, `object`, or `ListItem` used to render the list.

### NavigationDrawers
- `onVisibilityToggle` deprecated. Please use the `onVisibilityChange` prop instead.
- `temporaryIconClassName` and `temporaryIconChildren` deprecated. Please use the `temporaryIcon` prop instead.
- `persistentIconClassName` and `persistentIconChildren` deprecated. Please use the `persistentIcon` prop instead.

### Pickers
### Date Pickers
- `previousIconChildren` and `previousIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `previousIcon` prop instead.
- `nextIconChildren` and `nextIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `nextIcon` prop instead.
- `initialCalendarDate` deprecated. Please use `defaultCalendarDate` instead.

### Portals
All the components that were using the `Portal` component in the previous release are *not* using it by default now.
The `Portal` ended up being too much of a hassle when dealing with server side rendering since it renders in a new
subtree once the DOM is available. Components affected:

- `BottomNavigation`
- `Dialog`
- `Drawer`
- `NavigationDrawer`
- `Snackbar`
- `DatePicker`/`TimePicker`

If it is still desired to have the `Portal` subtree rendering enabled for these components, just enable `portal` as
a prop.

> The Drawer/NavigationDrawer will still render the overlay for temporary drawers in a new subtree. If the Drawer
starts out as `defaultVisible` from the server, there _might_ be a server side rendering error message still.

### SelectFields
- `iconChildren` and `iconClassName` disabled. Please use the `dropdownIcon` prop instead.
- `isOpen` deprecated. Please use the `visibile` prop instead.
- `defaultOpen` deprecated. Please use the `defaultVisible` prop instead.
- `onMenuToggle` deprecated. Please use the `onVisibilityChange` prop instead.
- `stretchList` deprecated. Maybe use `sameWidth` instead. Might not need any real changes.

### SelectionControls
#### SelectionControl
- `checkedCheckboxIconChildren`, `checkedCheckboxIconClassName`, `uncheckedCheckboxIconChildren` and `uncheckedCheckboxIconClassName` deprecated.
Please use the `checkedCheckboxIcon` and `checkedCheckboxIcon` props instead.
- `checkedRadioIconChildren`, `checkedRadioIconClassName`, `uncheckedRadioIconChildren` and `uncheckedRadioIconClassName` deprecated.
Please use the `checkedRadioIcon` and `checkedRadioIcon` props instead.

#### Checkbox/Radio
- `checkedIconChildren` and `checkedIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `checkedIcon` prop instead.
- `uncheckedIconChildren` and `uncheckedIconClassName` deprecated. Please use the `uncheckedIcon` prop instead.

### TextFields
- `passwordIconChildren` and `passwordIconClassName` deprecated. Please use `passwordIcon` instead.
