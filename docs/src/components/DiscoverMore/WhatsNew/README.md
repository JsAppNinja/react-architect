### react-md@1.1.0 Released
Please see the [upgrade guide](/discover-more/upgrade-guides/v1.1.0) for upgrade help.

A lot of components had their props renamed to follow a more consistent naming scheme between all components. There were a couple
of components that still used `isOpen`, `defaultOpen`, or `onSOMETHINGToggle` (`onVisibilityToggle`). They have now been renamed to `visible`, `defaultVisible`,
and `onSOMETHINGChange` (`onVisibilityChange`). This _should_ not break any functionality in your app, but it will display helpful
migration messages for you.

Touched Components: `Drawer`, `NavigationDrawer`, `Menu`, `MenuButton`, `SelectField`, `Autocomplete`, `SelectFieldColumn`, `EditDialogColumn`.

The `Menu` component has been completely redone to attempt to keep itself within the current viewport. This means that all the components
that also used this have been modified. The only thing that should be an immediate concern is that the width of `Autocomplete`s in a toolbar
will no longer span the entire viewport width on mobile devices. More work is being done behind the scenes to automatically position the menu.
Finally, cascading menus have been fully integrated.

To help combat the weird resizing of content when a `Dialog` is opened, the `html` has been modified to gain a
`min-width: 100%`. This can be changed by the [md-html-min-width](/customization/typography?tab=1#variable-md-html-min-width) variable.

### App Breaking Changes
##### Menus
If you were using context menus before, please see the upgrade guide for new behavior.

#### Dialogs
If you were using the UMD build or specifying `import { Dialog } from 'react-md'`, your app will probably now
be broken. One of the changes that was made in this release was to expose the `Dialog` itself instead of just
the container that displays it.
```js
// Before
import { Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD

// After
import { DialogContainer as Dialog } from 'react-md';
const { DialogContainer: Dialog } = window.ReactMD; // UMD
```

#### Tables
If you were using the callbacks for when a row or checkbox was clicked, the number will probably be off now. Please see
the [issue for more details](#issues-243).

##### Changelog
You can see the [milestone for this release](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=milestone%3Av1.1.0) to see what went in it.

### General Website Updates
There were some minor improvements done to the documentation website to hopefully make
finding component documentation or SassDoc easier.

- It is now possible to be redirect to a specific prop type for a component. Ex:
[/components/cards?tab=1#card-proptypes-animate](http://localhost:8080/components/cards?tab=1#card-proptypes-animate)
This mostly means that component prop type descriptions have been updated to link to related components/props.
- SassDoc will now redirect correctly when clicking on any Sass variable/mixin/function/placeholder in the "Requires",
"Used By", and "See" sections.
- When using the search functionality on the website, Sass variables will now have their values displayed in the autocomplete
list.

created. [#389](#issues-389)

## July 2017
### v1.0.17 Released
This patch was mostly about fixing components that needed to be resized after a container height/width
update instead of just a window resize event. In addition, there have been some mobile device performance
and behavior changes. Components that manually added touch events now use passive events when possible and
the user can focus a text field and scroll the page without automatically hiding the keyboard like a native
input element.

##### Changelog

just a `display: block` or whatever. [#365](#issues-365)
- Fixed the TimePicker changing days when AM/PM was toggled. [#446](#issues-446)
- Fixed the TimePicker to remember the last selected time better. [#438](#issues-438)

- Fixed multiple components that manually calculate size for container resize events instead of just window resize events.
  - ExpansionPanels and Tabs [#448](#issues-448)
  - Multiline TextFields [#365](#issues-365)
  - TablePagination [#415](#issues-415)

### v1.0.14 Released
This patch is mostly for keyboard accessibility updates so that the custom components interact the same way
as native form inputs.

##### Changelog
- Updated the menu component so that it correctly closes when a list item is "clicked" with spacebar or enter.
[#360](#issues-360)

## April 2017
### Added Showcases
Added a new place to showcase apps that are using react-md. You can view them [here](/discover-more/showcases).

### v1.0.12 Released
This release is mostly about fixing some of the cross-browser support and weird issues in mobile safari.
In addition, an [examples folder](https://github.com/mlaursen/react-md/tree/master/examples) has been added
to hopefully help newer people get a react-md project started up.

In addition, I decided to move the ticket from `v1.1.0` to `v1.0.12` about the annoying delay when a menu/drawer/toast
is closed by a click action.

##### Changelog

### v1.0.11 Released

## December 2016
### v1.0.0 Released!

This is the first prod-ready release of react-md. The library still isn't completely perfect, but I think it is close enough.

#### TL;DR
- Opt-in mixin component styles (or `@include react-md-everything;`)
- BEM Styles
- Grid System!
- Not fully backwards compatible.
- Accessibility focused.


##### Changelog
- Fixed the [background color bug](#commit-49ce0717af9a63530c1239b0b18c9bd1941a0914).
- Fixed the pre-compiled bundles to actually reflect what my documentation said. The pre-compiled bundles
are now formatted as `PRIMARY-COLOR_SECONDARY_COLOR.min.css` instead of `PRIMARY-COLOR-SECONDARY-COLOR.MIN.CSS`.
- Created a [mixin to create color class names](#commit-14e19f3c767ed9901f94a36ee89da238b36e2a09).
- Fixed the injectINK HOC for [keyboard _clicks_](#commit-59dff18cfd8b5b3923b1fb346ef699d8bad3b302).
- FileInput/FileUpload [bugfixes](#commit-2c4e1111fc53e25df94db67a43b892dfb94c0e50).

- Updated SelectField [keyboard accessibility](#commit-ffe270be18f2c957f2f257db800e1e602ba00e15).
- Updated tooltips to no longer rotate along with the `.md-collapser`s.
- Updated tooltips to be created through react components instead of my weird decision of creating it manually myself. [75eb2e0](#commit-75eb2e0a6616e6109141fc38cb88b35527d52eff)
- Rewrote SelectFieldColumn. [#170](#issues-170)
- Added the `getCurrentMedia` static method to the `NavigationDrawer` as well.
- Updated permanent drawers to no longer use the Portal.
- Updated the `Dialog` component to be able to be closed by pressing the escape key (only if not a `modal`). [b742ed5c](#commit-b742ed5cedaff0e79c6b812794ffe1bf4d567258)
- Updated the Date and Time pickers to have _some_ [keyboard accessibility](#issues-173). This still isn't the ideal solution
and will be changed in a future release (maybe?) to actually allow inline date and time selection that will appear in dropdowns.
- Updated `FocusContainer` to be able to enable/disable the focus containment after being fully mounted.

### General Website Changes

SassDoc pages are now searchable and filterable while on that page itself. I found that using the main search
to attempt to keep finding variables on the same page was a bit annoying. The SassDoc page can now be quick navigated
by clicking the visible FAB and clicking any items in the new Drawer.


### v1.0.0-beta Released

This release fixed up a couple more bugs (listed below) and now the main focus will be figuring out if there are any
production-breaking bugs remaining.

##### Changelog
- Fixed the Avatar colors changing [#161](#issues-161)
- Updated EditDialogColumn to interact correctly with keyboard focus and touch devices
- Fixed the `Dialog` to remove the prevent scroll className when unmounting
- Updated the `Drawer.getCurrentMedia` function to use the `Drawer.defaultProps` as the default value of the `props` parameter.
- Updated the `Drawer` to allow for a _persistent_ temporary Drawer on desktop devices.
- Fixed the `AccessibleFakeButton` to no longer use the space key as an enter keypress.
- Fixed a weird warning on inks if the `waitForInkTransition` prop was enabled and the click event eventually
unmounted the inked component.
- Updated the Menu to correctly remove the window click event on unmount.
- Added correct deprecation notices to the `SelectField` and fixed the keyboard accessibility when using a `SelectField.Positions.BELOW` position.
- Fixed the duplication of the `md-background--primary-hover` and `md-background--secondary-hover`.
- Fixed the duplication of `md-background--primary-hover` and renamed the second one to `md-background--secondary-hover`.
- Minor CSS Fixes



## November 2016
### General Website Changes

With the upcoming `v1.0.0` release, the website has been remade to allow quicker navigation, searching, and finding
related documentation.
- A [Theme Builder](/customization/themes?tab=1) has also been added that allows you to pick and
choose a theme on your website.
- Examples and Prop Types have been separated into different tabs to help separate content a bit more.
- Most SassDoc can be viewed with the related component in a new SassDoc tab.
- The main search now includes sass placeholders, variables, functions, and mixins that will either redirect you to
the correct SassDoc tab, or to the [SassDoc Page](/sassdoc).

### v1.0.0.alpha.4 Released

The main focus of this release was adding a `JumpToContent` link for the `NavigationDrawer` for keyboard accessibility. When you use
the `NavigationDrawer` (or specifically use the `JumpToContentLink` component), the first `tab` press on the page will show a link that
will allow a user to focus the main content of the page instead of having to go through every navigation item.

### v1.0.0.alpha.3 Released

This release was focused on having a more consistent naming convention. Boolean props are now `adjective` instead of
`isAdjective` and any prop that was `initiallyProp` was renamed `defaultProp` to match how React handles the base html
tag defaults. This also included some small bugfixes as well as updating the Portal component to stop using the undocumented
`CSSPropertyOperations` since it crashed in React 15.4.0.

The `SelectField` was also updated to no longer use the `TextField` component internally and behave more like [the html select](#issues-144).

### v1.0.0.alpha.2 Released

Fixed the UMD build so that the `default` was not needed from the browser for `ReactMD.COMPONENT`.

### v1.0.0.alpha.1 Released

I found out I messed up the naming with a `.` instead of `-` so the future releases are messed up. Whoops. But this change basically
added the old v0.3.7 styles back into the `dist` folder for UMD.


### v1.0.0-alpha Released

Whew. This was a big change. This was a complete rewrite from nested CSS priority to using my first attempt at BEM (so it definitely
isn't perfect). The Sass also changed to an _opt-in_ `mixin` framework. Styles will no longer be included when importing the `scss` files.
The styles can be created by using `react-md-everything` or `react-md-COMPONENTs`. This allows for access to variables by one import instead
of having to specify multiple. Also, the dark theme was finally finished! Woo! Exciting! See the [upgrade guide](/discover-more/upgrade-guides/v1.0.0#now-vs-previous-versions)
for more information.

Some other under-the-hood changes are that as many components as possible use the `PureComponent` instead of the `PureRenderMixin`
with a `Component`. This release also changed my goals from this project. This project's goal is now to be a completely accessible React/Sass UI
framework for material design.

Finally, a material design [Grid System](/customization/grids) was created so positioning is even easier than before.
