There are four types of buttons in react-md:
- flat
- raised
- icon
- floating

Starting from v1.1.0, the dense spec for icons has been implemented. This means that the icon and floating buttons
will be smaller when matching the desktop media query than when on mobile devices. See the
[dense spec variable](/components/font-icons?tab=2#variable-md-font-icon-include-dense) for more information.

All of these types can be styled using the primary, secondary, or theme's colors. `flat` and `icon` buttons
will theme the text color in the button while `raised` and `floating` will theme the background of the button.

You can also create a link with all the styles of the button by providing an `href` prop to any of the buttons.
They will be updated to render as an `<a>` tag instead of a `button`.

When a button is disabled, any theming will be removed and any interactions will be removed.
