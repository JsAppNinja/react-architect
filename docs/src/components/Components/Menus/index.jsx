  description: `
The \`MenuButton\` and \`DropdownMenu\` components require a list of \`menuItems\` to display as \`ListItem\`.
The menu items can either be:
- \`number\`
- \`string\`
- \`object\`
- \`ListItem\`

If the item is a \`number\` or a \`string\`, it will be displayed as a \`ListItem\`'s \`primaryText\`.
If the item is an \`object\`, it will consider it an object of \`ListItem\` \`props\` and just pass it
to the \`ListItem\` component. Finally, if it is the \`ListItem\`, it will be displayed as-is.

  description: `
The \`DropdownMenu\` component is a bit lower level than the \`MenuButton\` because you will need to create
your own \`toggle\` component for the \`Menu\` to attach to. It is useful since it allows you to create
some more interesting components than what is only available with the \`MenuButton\`.

  title: '"Smart" Positioning Menus',
  description: `
Starting from \`react-md@1.1.0\`, menus can be updated to use "smart" positioning to move their location
to stay within the viewport. If a user attempts to open a menu that is near the bottom of the screen, the
menu will now appear above instead of below. When the user scrolls the page while the menu is open, the
menu will move with the page until it can no longer be displayed in the viewport and then automatically hides.
If it is possible to switch the location of the menu from top to bottom or bottom to top, it will do so. The
menu can also be hidden automatically if the user attempts to scroll instead by disabling the \`repositionOnScroll\`
prop.

The biggest difference between these menus and the default version is that their positioning is handled by inline
styles instead of external css. Because of the inline styling, it might be better to keep the non-"smart" menus
enabled in general cases when complex positioning is required or the menus are tied to text fields.

> See the Autocomplete example below for more details about problems with "smart" menus and text fields.

Try scrolling around the page before and after opening the menus below to see how the "smart" menus can reposition
or hide based on screen location. You can also check out these examples:

- [SelectField "Smart" Menus](/components/select-fields#using-smart-menus)

  title: 'Google Docs Clone',
  description: `
The following example is a Google docs clone with about 0.01% of the functionality! It is quite amazing
if I do say so myself. The main purpose of this demo is to show how you can create cascading menus and
custom context menus.

> NOTE: This is a **very complex** example and there is a lot of code (1500+ lines). This should really only
be viewed if you have a good understanding of the majority of the components in react-md
