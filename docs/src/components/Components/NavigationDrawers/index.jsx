If you saw the [Drawer](/components/drawers) examples before this example, hopefully the
\`NavigationDrawer\` example will be simple since it is just a wrapper. It exposes props
to pass to both the \`Drawer\` and \`Toolbar\` components.

route to actually view the demo. Please click the link below to see this example in action. The code for the example
is still available here by clicking the code expander button.
