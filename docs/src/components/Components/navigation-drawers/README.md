The `NavigationDrawer` component is normally used for a full-page layout. It will combine
the `Toolbar` and `Drawer` components in a nice way as well as displaying your main content.
In addition, when a `full-height` drawer type is used, it will add a keyboard-only tabbable
link that will allow keyboard users to skip the entire navigation process and start looking
at the main content.

### NavigationDrawer vs Drawer/Toolbar
The `NavigationDrawer` component is just a simple way to combine a main fixed `Toolbar` and a `Drawer`
component on the page. It will handle any of the positioning and offsets required for you. It will definitely
be less flexible than the `Drawer/Toolbar` manual combo yourself.
