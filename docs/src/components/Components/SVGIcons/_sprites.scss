// The svg-sprite-loader creates a .sprite-symbol-usage class name when on IE 11 and sets it to display: none
// until it becomes :target. However, we want the icons to always be visible and this solution doesn't
// appear to work. When on IE 11, it creates an SVG with all the symbol defs as the first element in
// the body. We can work around this problem by targeting the react-app tree and then setting it to
// visible in there.
.sprite-symbol-usage.sprite-symbol-usage {
  display: inline;
}
