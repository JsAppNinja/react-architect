Avatars can can be used to symbolize people or objects. They are generally used to give a more personalized
feeling on a website for each user.

An avatar can be made from one of the following:
- an image
- a `FontIcon`,
- a letter

An avatar can be created by providing a `src` prop pointing to the URL of the image.
When an avatar is an image, the `alt` or `role="presentation"` props should be provided
for accessibility.

When the avatar contains an icon or a letter, the colors can be defined by specifying a `suffix` that links into the
[md-avatar-colors](/components/avatars?tab=2#variable-md-avatar-colors) or by enabling `random` to randomly choose
one of the suffixes to apply.
