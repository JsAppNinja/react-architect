Data tables display raw data sets. They usually appear in desktop enterprise products.

#### Responsiveness
By default, the data tables will be responsive by allowing the user to scroll left/right when there is too
much content to be viewed at once.

#### Table Types
In `react-md`, data tables come in two types: `plain` and `selectable` where `selectable` is the default.
A `plain` data table is not part of the material design specs and attempts to just add the base styles for
a table and allow any sized content to be displayed. A `selectable` data table will inject checkboxes as
the first column and allow each row to be selected.

#### Performance
If you are working with large data sets and have heavy table edit abilities, it is recommended
to use a virtualization library such as [react-virtualized](https://github.com/bvaughn/react-virtualized)
instead of my tables. The html `<table>` is already pretty slow if you don't use fixed layouts and know
the exact size of each cell beforehand. When all the event listeners and styles have been applied for
the data table, you might start noticing performance issues around a 20x20 table. If a virtualization
library isn't your thing, you can always try to paginate the results with the `TablePagination` component
to limit the number of rendered rows/columns at a time
