A select field is called a Dropdown Button in the
[material design specs](https://www.google.com/design/spec/components/buttons.html#buttons-dropdown-buttons).


A dropdown button selects between multiple selections. The button
displays the current state and a down arrow. Available states may
be shown as a list of strings, a palette, or icons, for example.

In `react-md`, Select Fields are an extension of the `TextField` component
with additional events to open the menu. The Select Field will automatically
update the text field's size to be the largest menu item's label.
