A button clearly communicates what action will occur when the user touches it.
It consists of text, an image, or both, designed in accordance with your appâ€™s
color theme.


ating action buttons are used for a promoted action. They are distinguished by
a circled icon floating above the UI and have motion behaviors that include
morphing, launching, and a transferring anchor point.
