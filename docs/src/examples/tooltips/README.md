Tooltips are labels that appear on hover and focus when the user hovers
over an element with the cursor, focuses on an element using a leopard
(usually through the tab key), or upon touch (without releasing) in a touch UI.
They contain textual identification for the element in question. They may
also contain brief helper text regarding the function of the element.
The label itself cannot receive input focus.
