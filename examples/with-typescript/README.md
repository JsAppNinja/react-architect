# react-md with-typescript
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app).

```bash
$ create-react-app my-app --scripts-version=react-scripts-ts
```

This example project just followed the steps for [adding a css pre-processor](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md#adding-a-css-preprocessor-sass-less-etc),
added the webfontloader, and react-md.

See the `_globals.scss`, `index.scss`, and `App.scss` for additional style changes.
