React material design - React components built with sass (*oh no she didn't!*)

```bash
$ npm install -S react \
                 react-dom \
                 react-addons-transition-group \
                 react-addons-css-transition-group \

# Getting Started

## Prerequisites

To use this libarary, it is recommended to have previous experience using React components along with sass/css. In addition, you should use an autoprefixer to support multiple browsers. The sass
files are currently prefix-free.

If you want to use the `DatePicker` or the `TimePicker` components, you m ust either include the [Intl polyfill](https://github.com/andyearnshaw/Intl.js/) or implement your own if you need to
support browsers that do not have it implemented. [See caniuse](http://caniuse.com/#search=intl).

This project was developed with the [Roboto font](https://www.google.com/fonts/specimen/Roboto) in mind. Make sure to include the font library locally or from the cdn (or some font equivalent).

Finally, some form of font icon library should be included. The defaults for this project are using [material-icons](https://design.google.com/icons/), but any font library can be used. (Hopefully).
There are some mixins for helping pull these font libraries in from a cdn or locally hosted.

> Note: Most components are using the `PureRenderMixin`. So if a component isn't updating as expected, it is probably because you used updated an object or list prop without creating a new reference.

## Customizing the theme

Hopefully the [generated sassdoc](https://mlaursen.com/react-md/sassdoc) will help with
mixin usage and sass documentation.

There is a sass function called `get-md-color($color, $hue, $secondary)` that can be used to set the primary and secondary colors for your application. It is based off of
the [Material design color palette](https://www.google.com/design/spec/style/color.html#color-color-palette).

The default colors are `indigo` and `pink` (hue A200). You can theme your application by either changing the default color variables:

```
$md-primary-color: $md-indigo-500 !default;
$md-secondary-color: $md-pink-a-200 !default;
```

Or defining your own theme with the theme mixins.
[Examples in \_theme.scss](../master/src/scss/_theme.scss).

## Media queries

The default media queries for detecting if mobile are very simple. Anything below 600px is considered mobile.
If these do not work for you, you can use the correct mixins for making a component styled
for mobile/desktop.

See [the example \_media-queries.scss](../master/src/scss/_media-queries.scss) source.


# Known Bugs/Works in Progress/Future Changes

* Scrollable tabs do not exist for desktop. Wasn't sure how to calculate it yet or set it up.
* Autocomplete
* Data Tables -- there is some starter css for tables in [\_data-tables.scss](../master/src/scss/components/_data-tables.scss) but no components with functionality.
* Bottom sheets
* Grid lists
* Steppers
* Eventually add Floating button transitions/morphing abilities. Ex: Speed Dial, Morph into toolbar/material/paper
* Eventually add a way to use chips in text fields
* Eventually update for dark themes
